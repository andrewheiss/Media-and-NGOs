## Abstract

In democratic societies, the relationship between social movements and the media is asymmetrical—movements need media but media do not necessarily need to cover social movements to be successful. To gain media support for their causes, movements change their message and reframe their causes to be more palatable for media audiences. Additionally, under autocratic regimes, opposition organizations and independent media must navigate enhanced government scrutiny. This project will focus on the relationship between independent media and the nonprofit sector in autocratic societies. 

Given the expected asymmetrical relationship between media and social movements, what is the relationship between independent media and civil society organizations in Egypt? How and under what conditions does media coverage of NGO activities differ? To answer these questions, we will examine the case of Egypt Independent, a non-state English-language news outlet which covered Egyptian politics and society until 2013. From a list of NGOs that were created to monitor government corruption, we will perform content analysis of the Independent's coverage of corruption-related events—such as Hosni Mubarak's ongoing criminal trial, and others—examining the use of anti-corruption NGOs as news sources and determining which NGO messages are most salient.
